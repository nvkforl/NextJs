Next build,start and export

Next build - Builds the application for production in the .next folder

next start - starts a node.js server that supports hybrid pages, serving both statically generated and server-side rendered(SSR) pages

next export - exports all the pages to static HTML, that can be served without the need of node.js server
                - can be hosted in CDN
                - cannot be used for ISR (incemetal server rendeting) and SSR (Server side rendering)
                - can be used for landing pages,blogs and any app where the content is generated at build time


using next export                
-----------------
1. in package.json 

  "scripts": {
        ....
        "export":"next build && next export",
        ....
  },
2. npm run export - to build the app
    - should not use getServerSideProps in the  code
    - we can use getStaticProps. conditions apply - need to hard code the fallback=false for [blodId].js like pages
    - cannot use "next/image" componet in this
