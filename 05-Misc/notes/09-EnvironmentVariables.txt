Env Variables
-------------

1. Create a file .env.local
2. This file is git ignored 
3. process.env we cannot destructure 
4. To reflect the changes we need to build the app, then only the changes will take effect
5. by defalut process.env Variables are not rendered in ui so that developer need not expose that value
6. If you want to expose the env Variables the need to prefix the vaiable with "NEXT_"
        Ex: NEXT_PUBLIC_VIEW=123
