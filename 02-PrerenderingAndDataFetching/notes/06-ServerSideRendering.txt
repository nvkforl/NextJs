There are Two types of rendering 
1. Static generation
2. Server-Side generation

Problems of Static generation
-----------------------------
1. pages are generated at build time
2. due to build time and generated only once there is a high chances for stale data



Advantages of Server-Side generation
------------------------------------
1. pages are generated at RunTime
2. we use getServerSideProps() will run on server side only
3. So the code logic will be hidden in the server itself and will not be exposed to the clent side
4. So access the File System from fs module or querying a DB can be done inside getServerSideProps
5. API keys can also be added in the getServerSideProps itself so that it will not be rendered to the client
6. it runs inside a page only and connot be created as component
7. So it can be used as pre-rendering but not data fetching
8. getServerSideProps will return a object and object contains props key as an object
9. getServerSideProps will run for each request


Client side Data-fetching
-------------------------

1. reactJs we use useEffect hook so when the component is mounted the data will be fetched
2. To handle this in NextJs, provides SWR
3. SWR is the react hook while data fetching 
    - catching
    - revalidation 
    - focus tracking 
    - refeching in interval and so on...

4.SWR (Stale while Re-validate) - A cache invalidation stratgy 
5. installing SWR - npm install swr

6. router.push("/events?category=sports", undefined, { shallow: true });
        Shallow Routing helps in bookmarking the search and Helps in SEO
