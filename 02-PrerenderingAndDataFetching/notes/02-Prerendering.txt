what is pre-rendering ?

HTML code is generated in the server side itself.

in ReactJs - we have the Root element and HTML elements are hidden inside the JavaScript

in NextJS - There HTML is rendered as it is, i.e HTML not hidden in JS so it helps in SEO.

There are 2 Types of rendering

1. Static Generation
2. Server-Side Rendering
