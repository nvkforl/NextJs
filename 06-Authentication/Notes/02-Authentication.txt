Identity and Access
    Identity  verifies who the user is  - Authentication    
    Access verifies what permission the user has - Authorization

1. In react app, it deals with authenticating the client side code
2. in Next.js app, has three types for Authentication
    a. Client-side Authentication
    b. Server-side Authentication
    c. API Routes Authorization

4. if you do not want to persist the data the go for Auth services like Github,FB,Gmail
5. if you want to persist the data the go for DB

So we need to use next-auth.js
