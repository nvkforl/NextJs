our blog page we display free post and we want him to login
so when when he is not logged in  then we need to redirect him to login page


  if session does not exist then redirect to login page
  permanent: false -> refers to this url redirect is not
  permanent and is applicable only of user is not logged in
  
  if (!session) {
    return {
      redirect: {
        destination: `/api/auth/signin?callbackUrl=http://localhost:3000/blog`,
        permanent: false,
      },
    };
  }
