1. what is the diffrence between React.Js and Next.Js ?
        React is not full Production ready framework, as we need to handle the Routing,
    styling,Authentication etc

        where as in next.js comes with full fledged production ready app by providing
    Routing,styling,Authentication,styling,bundle optimization
    so no need to manually install other packages
    
2. Featues of Next.js
    a. File based Routing - in react you need to install 3rd party lib for rerouting
            but in Next.js it is inbuilt and components inside Pages folder itself 
            acts as a router
    
    b. pre-rendering - next.js generates HTML for each page in advance insted of 
            having done by client side itself. better perfomance and useful for SEO
        
    c. API Routes - create APIs from next, create UI as well as API.

    d. Support for CSS modules - supports out of the box, independently write CSS for 
            each page

    e. Authentication - supports diffrent Authentication patterns

    f. Dev and Prod build system - concentrate on BL rather than configuration

3. Creating a new App 
        npx create-next-app hello
