[...params].js is an example of catch all routes
1.  http://localhost:/3000/api/one/two/three
    output in browser is : ["one","two","three"]

2. http://localhost:/3000/api
    output: we will get 404 error

3. if we rename the file as [[...params]].js   
    then for the url http://localhost:/3000/api -> we will not get 404 error
    but need to delete /pages/api/index.js in order to work with [[...params]].js
